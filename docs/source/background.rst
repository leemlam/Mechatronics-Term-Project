Template stuff
--------------

Template stuff is going to go below for reference when creating the other sections

.. note::

    This is a note format. not sure if we will need this at all


Code blocks can be done like this::

    print("Hello World!")

Alternatively can use ``these`` for code samples, **these** for bold, and *these* for italics

Note the blank spaces and indentation defining what the format applies to.

Use * for bullets, 1. or #. for numbered lists. # autonumbers

* Hi

    * Bradley

* Kern

#. Whats
#. Up

You can also do tables like latex. Use this for reference

+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| (header rows optional) |            |          |          |
+========================+============+==========+==========+
| body row 1, column 1   | column 2   | column 3 | column 4 |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| body row 2             | ...        | ...      |          |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+

you can also make tables from CSVs so might want to use that

I can reference other pages with :doc:`PID` and sub-sections with :ref:`installation`.
Links to other sites can be done `like this <https://www.reddit.com/r/FSAE/comments/du3a18/legends_never_die/>`__
Hopefully I understand this well enough..
